Royal Mail

Company Overview
-	Royal Mail has been focusing on using big data, robotic process automation, robotics, cloud, and drones among others to digitally transform its operations. The annual ICT spending of Royal Mail was estimated at $450,997 for 2024. A major share of this spending is earmarked for acquiring software, network and communications, and hardware from vendors. Royal Mail, a subsidiary of International Distributions Services plc, delivers letters and parcels to more than 30 million addresses across the UK. The company, which traces its roots to a postal service exclusively created for the King and his court, delivers six days a week across the UK. Royal Mail became a private company in 2013. Parcels account for the majority of Royal Mail’s revenue. Royal Mail’s partner companies include Parcel force Worldwide, stamp retailers, and British Heart Foundation.

Implementation process & challenges
-	In order to modernise its operations, increase efficiency, and control expansion in the increasingly digital and parcel-driven postal business, Royal Mail implemented the SAP ERP system. With an emphasis on key areas like finance, procurement, and logistics, the process started with meticulous planning, customisation, and training. But there were a lot of difficulties with the implementation. Delays and budget overruns were common since the project went above its original budget and schedule. Employees had trouble acclimating to the new system, and operational disruptions resulted from integration problems with existing systems. 

Key failure factors
-	From April 2023 to March 2024, Royal Mail only delivered 74.7% of First Class mail on time and 92.7% of Second Class mail on time. The company blamed its poor performance on its challenging financial position, and delays to the ballot on a deal that followed the previous year's industrial action.

Outcomes & consequences
-	In order to scale its expanding parcel delivery services, increase efficiency, and modernise operations, Royal Mail installed a SAP ERP system. The system was created to improve data visibility for decision-making while streamlining procedures in supply chain management, HR, finance, and procurement. It also sought to improve logistics and delivery tracking in order to improve customer service. Significant obstacles to the implementation, however, included budget overruns, delays, and system integration issues, which resulted in operational disruptions and early employee resistance. Notwithstanding these obstacles, the ERP system eventually assisted Royal Mail in increasing productivity, fostering corporate expansion, and effectively overseeing its enlarged e-commerce operations.
